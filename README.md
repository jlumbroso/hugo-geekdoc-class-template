# "Geekdocs Class" Course Website Template

This repository is a self-contained template to create a course website:
- using Hugo static site generator,
- hosted on GitHub,
- deployed to GitHub Pages hosting,
- using the continuous integration available through GitHub Actions,
- with (optionally) a custom domain name.

It builds on the [Geekdocs theme](https://geekdocs.de/) for Hugo, and is inspired by Kevin Lin's Just-the-Class Jekyll template based on the [Just-the-Docs theme](https://pmarsceill.github.io/just-the-docs/) for Jekyll. This template uses files from both of these projects under their respective MIT licenses.

It is designed to work well both on desktop and mobile — and to make it easy to create a course website with a schedule, announcements, staff listings, and modules. It is also designed to be easy to customize and extend.
